## Slide 5: Understanding the YAML Structure üìù

**Description:** The YAML structure follows a logical hierarchy that makes workflows easy to read and maintain. Each level serves a specific purpose in the automation process.

**Structure Breakdown:**
```yaml
name: Workflow Name          # Human-readable identifier
on: [push, pull_request]    # Event triggers
jobs:                       # Collection of work
  job-name:                 # Individual job identifier
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Execution environment
    steps:                  # Sequential tasks
      - name: Step Name     # Human-readable step
        run: command        # Command to execute
```
